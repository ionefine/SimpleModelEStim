# SimpleModelEStim
A simple model of electrical stimulation. The units are as real as possible except for the fact that I seem to be off by a factor of 1000. Sigh.

The model is currently set up to simulate one of the conditions in this paper

Your homework is to run some kind of experiment (e.g. looking at the effect of electrode size or pulse duration), or improve the model in some way, using GitHub.
